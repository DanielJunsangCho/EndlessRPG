Hello! This C++ project is a "game" that I created using a queue, hashtable, and multiple class files. The concept of it is that the user inputs various pieces of information about the hero and the enemies. These enemies will then be put into a hastable where their stats will be calculated and then get put into a "dungeon" (queue). The hero will then move through the dungeon and fight enemies until they die.
